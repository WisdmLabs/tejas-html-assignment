    <p class="section-content">You will be able to participate in live class meetings via Zoom videoconference. To attend classes, you'll need a phone, tablet or computer and access to the internet. You can participate in the class from wherever you'd like, whether on your living room couch or in your office. Before your class meets, you'll receive an email from The Proprietary with more information about Zoom and your remote class. If you have any questions about remote learning, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at <span style="color:#00ACB4;">hello@wisdmlabs.com.</span>
